# Looser_Game
For my final project in the Basic Programming course, i was assigned to create a command-line game using C. I built the "Loser Game," an interactive CLI game that put my C programming skills to the test. Ultimately, my project earned a score of 130 out of 100. I wish you enjoy it :))))
